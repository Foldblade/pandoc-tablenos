This directory contains regression tests.  Running `make` produces out/demo-*.pdf files that you may inspect visually.  Note that the Makefile expects specific numbered pandoc targets (e.g., pandoc-1.17.0.2) are available from the shell.  You will likely have to adapt the Makefile to use what is available on your system.

Note that the spacing in the output pdf files varies because of pandoc.  Everything else should visually remain the same.
